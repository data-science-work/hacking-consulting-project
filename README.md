# Clustering Consulting Project

### Clustering hackers
A company got hacked and they have gathered valuable data to figure out how many hacker actually got into their system. The technology firm has 3 potential hackers that perpetrated the attach. Their certain of the first two hackers but they are not very sure if the third hacker was involved or not. One last key fact is that the forensic engineer knows that the hackers trade off attacks, meaning they should each have roughly the same amount of attacks. For example, if there were 100 total attacks, then in a 2 hacker situation each should have about 50 hacks.
